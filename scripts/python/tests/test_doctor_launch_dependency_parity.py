"""Plan D Task 3: doctor must gate on the commands `squad up` gates on.

README's Quickstart runs ``squad doctor`` immediately before ``squad up``, so
doctor is the documented pre-flight for the launcher's hard dependency gate.
Measured 2026-08-17 against bin/doctor.sh's 1,390 lines: the strings ``fswatch``,
``uv`` and ``curl`` appeared ZERO times, while bin/launch-squad.sh exits 1
without them. A cloner missing fswatch therefore read a green health report and
then could not launch -- the pre-flight passing for the launch it pre-flights.

These tests pin both halves:

  1. every command on the shared list is actually probed, and a missing one is
     an ISSUE (exit 1), not a warning the exit code ignores; and
  2. the launcher and doctor read the SAME list, so it cannot drift back apart.

SAFETY: doctor runs in a throwaway tree with a stubbed HOME. Every dependency,
including tmux, is stubbed on the fixture's own PATH (doctor prepends
``$HOME/.local/bin``), so nothing here reaches the operator's repository, tmux
server, processes or doctor logs. bin/launch-squad.sh is READ, never run.
